# Critique of [Ann Killion's and Nanette Asimov's Cal's shockingly low athletic admission standards](http://www.sfgate.com/collegesports/article/Cal-s-shockingly-low-athletic-admission-standards-4984721.php#photo-5466327)

## What are the datasets used here, and where did they come from?
Killion and Asimov list the source of their data as UC Berkeley. In their story, the reporters compare the graduation rates of all female and male students, to the graduation rate of student athletes (also categorized by male and female). I assume the reporters found this data by themselves in UC Berkeley documents for students who entered the university from 1999 to 2005. But it could also be that UC Berkeley provided the reporters with:
1. Graduation rates for all students
2. Graduation rates for all student athletes

## What is the “birth story” of the data, e.g. how were they created in the first place?
As a public university, UC Berkeley must have to keep a record of all the students that graduate, and its Athletics department must keep a record of student athletes who graduate.

## What claims does the story make based on the data?
Killion and Asimov found that the graduation rate for student athletes is significantly **lower** than for the rest of the student body. For example, for the class of 2005-2006, only 55% of male athletes graduated, compared to 88% of all male students. The claims made in the story are:
* that the university is not providing enough support to student athletes to boost their academic achievements, 
* and that the university cares more about winning games and getting money for their new stadium.

## What are the limitations of the data?
* It doesn't show differences in the graduation rate of student athletes by sport (for example, if students who play water polo graduate significantly more than students who play football).
* It would also be great to include additional data that explains why in the 2002-2003 academic year, student athletes had a much higher graduation rate than all the years shown. 

## Can you find where this (original) data exists online? If so, post the relevant URLs. 

Not sure if this is the exact data source the reporters used, but here's UC Berkeley Office of Planning and Analysis [Undergraduate Graduation Rates](http://opa.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-graduation-rates)
